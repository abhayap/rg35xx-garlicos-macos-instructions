# Guides for Garlic OS on your Anbernic RG35XX using macOS

By Ryan Parman and contributors.

## A quick note on copyright, authorship, and licensing

These guides are licensed under the terms of the [Creative Commons Zero: 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license. The intention of choosing this license is to come as close to _public domain_/_copyright-free_ as possible, allowing others to freely copy and adapt this work in other forms.

Any pull requests that are merged from contributors will only be merged under the same licensing terms.

**Copyright** and **Authorship** are entirely different things. For example, YouTube videos that say "no copyright intended" clearly have no idea how copyright works. Copyright refers to being allowed to (or disallowed from) making copies (e.g., direct copies, adapting the work in new ways, etc.). Authorship is literally whomever created the thing. I (and any contributors) will be the authors for now until forever. But we are _giving up our copyrights_ (via this license) and allowing anyone to make copies and/or adapt the work for any purpose or reason.

Citing the authors is a decent thing to do when copying/adapting this work. Conversely, claiming it as your own is still _plagarism_ even if we're granting you permission to use this content however you see fit.

In short: don't be a dick.
