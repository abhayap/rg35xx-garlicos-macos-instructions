# A quick note on copyright, authorship, and licensing

## Quick Definitions

**Copyright** and **Authorship** are entirely different things. **Copyright** refers to being allowed to (or disallowed from) making copies (e.g., direct copies, adapting the work in new ways). **Authorship** is literally whomever created the thing. I (and any contributors) will be the authors for now until forever. But we are _licensing out work_ (via this license) and allowing people to do things with our work, as long as they follow some basic rules.

Citing the authors is required when copying/adapting this work. Conversely, claiming it as your own is still _plagarism_ even if we're granting you permission to use this content.

**In short:** cite your sources, don't make money on things you didn't write, and don't be a dick.

## Clarifications

I've been writing for a long time, giving away information and things I've learned for free. While I'd like to maintain that same "open" spirit moving forward, I'd also like to see if there is money to be made for the work I've done.

As the author and primary copyright holder of this work, I am actively seeking ways to make money from my own work. I am not seeking ways to make money from anyone else's work (unless there's a way to come up with a fair revenue-sharing model that I haven't figured out yet).

If I do reference someone else's work, it will be done in a way that falls under "fair use" law, or that aligns with any licenses that are applied to that work. Attribution, and linking back to the original source is part of that. _Fair use_ is an exception to copyright law that allows partial copies to be made in very specific use-cases, where the intent is clearly for educational purposes.
