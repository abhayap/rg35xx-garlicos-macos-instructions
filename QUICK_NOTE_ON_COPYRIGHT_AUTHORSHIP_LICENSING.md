# A quick note on copyright, authorship, and licensing

These guides are licensed under the terms of the [Creative Commons Zero: 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license. The intention of choosing this license is to come as close to _public domain_/_copyright-free_ as possible, allowing others to freely copy and adapt this work in other forms.

Any pull requests that are merged from contributors will only be merged under the same licensing terms.

**Copyright** and **Authorship** are entirely different things. **Copyright** refers to being allowed to (or disallowed from) making copies (e.g., direct copies, adapting the work in new ways). **Authorship** is literally whomever created the thing. I (and any contributors) will be the authors for now until forever. But we are _giving up our copyrights_ (via this license) and allowing anyone to make copies and/or adapt the work for any purpose or reason.

Citing the authors is a decent thing to do when copying/adapting this work. Conversely, claiming it as your own is still _plagarism_ even if we're granting you permission to use this content however you see fit.

In short: cite your sources, and don't be a dick.
